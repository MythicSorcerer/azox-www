# The Next Season

We wish everyone a happy holidays and a joyful new year! 

## The Problem

If you've been around this server for a long time (since before we moved to this domain), you probably know about the failures of the previous seasons.

Problems ranging from people speedrunning elytra with x-ray as soon as the server starts, to blatent admin abuse.

## Our Fix
This season, we will have live world backups every few hours and full server backups every 24 hours, with world backups being on github, meaning that even if the server died, I could still host from my laptop if I wanted to.

I have selected an assortment of the most advanced anticheat and cheat tracking mods, meaning that x-ray will be phisically impossible without seedcracking, but seedcracking is impossible because of world generation mods that alter structure and ore generation. 

To prevent the problem of blatent admin abuse, I will not be giving any players full OP permissions this season, including myself.

## Any other problems
If you think you see any other problems that you would like me adress in this server, shoot me a DM at @mythic\_sorcerer or email me at ideas@azox.net or suggestions@azox.net

### Season 3: SMP
That being said, I plan on implementing a azox coins system, giving minor rewards for logging on frequently or doing tasks, but making sure not to do anything that might diminish the experiece who choose not to interact with any non-vanilla features

## Release
Server release expected by the end of January, but could be pushed back if I hit some snags.
