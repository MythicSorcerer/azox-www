# 🎆 Happy New Year 2026! 🎆
Welcome back, everyone! We hope you all had an amazing holiday season. As we kick off the new year, we've got some exciting changes coming to the server!

## Difficulty Increased to Hard Mode
The server difficulty has been changed from Easy to Hard Mode! Get ready for tougher mobs, more challenging survival, and greater rewards. This change went live on January 5th, so sharpen your swords and stock up on supplies!

### Totems of Undying Now Obtainable (hard mode)

Totems of Undying are now available on the server! Hunt down those Woodland Mansions, grind those raids and take on the Evokers to get your hands on these life-saving items. Good luck out there!

## The future
To increase playercount and kill boredom, new minor changes will be added at the first of every month. A hint as to this month's change can be found on your sidebar. Check it out and stay posted under events.
