# About Azox Network

## From Humble Beginnings to a Thriving Community

What started as the Xenon SMP in late 2023—just a simple server for friends running on modest hardware—has evolved into something much bigger. Azox Network now hosts dozens of players in an environment that balances competitive survival gameplay with genuine fairness and accessibility.

The transformation wasn't planned. It happened organically as more players discovered a server that actually cared about their experience, their security, and their right to play—regardless of their Minecraft version or whether they own a premium account.

## One Admin, One Vision

I run Azox Network entirely myself, leveraging open-source software to keep the server independent, transparent, and community-focused. No corporate backing, no pay-to-win schemes—just a commitment to maintaining a server where gameplay skill matters more than your wallet.

This hands-on approach means every decision, every update, and every backup is handled with care. When you play on Azox, you're not just another username in a database. You're part of a server where the admin actually knows what's happening.

## Core Principles

**Fair Gameplay for Everyone**  
Every player deserves an equal shot at success. Advanced anti-cheat systems ensure that skill and strategy determine outcomes, not exploits or hacks. When problems arise, our 3-hour backup system means we can roll back griefing or damage instantly.

**Vanilla at Heart**  
Too many servers drown the Minecraft experience under mountains of plugins and modifications. Azox keeps it real. We enhance security and quality of life without destroying what makes Minecraft... Minecraft. You'll recognize the game you love, just with better protection.

**Open to All**  
Premium players, cracked players, Java edition, Bedrock edition—everyone is welcome. Gaming shouldn't be gatekept by arbitrary restrictions. If you want to play, you can play.

## Security You Can Trust

In a world where servers can vanish overnight or lose weeks of progress to crashes, Azox Network takes security seriously:

- **Automated backups every 3 hours** keep your progress safe
- **~100GB of SSD/NVME storage** dedicated to maintaining backup history
- **Latest backups synced to GitHub** for additional redundancy
- **Craftable land claims and chest protections** that are truly unbreakable
- **Hosted on Fedora 41 GNOME** with 8GB RAM allocated for optimal performance

Your builds, your progress, your time invested—all protected by systems designed with paranoia-level redundancy.

## Always Online, Always Ready

Azox Network has maintained consistent uptime since 2024, with downtime limited only to essential maintenance and updates. When you're ready to play, the server is ready for you.

## The Road Ahead

The current focus is helping players reach endgame content: maxed gear, maces, and sophisticated farms for raids and iron production. Once the community is fully geared, we're planning to construct an official arena for organized PvP duels—a place where alliances are tested and reputations are forged.

This isn't a server that's "finished." It grows with its players, adapts to what the community needs, and continues to push the boundaries of what a small, independently-run Minecraft server can achieve.

## Why Azox?

Most servers promise the world and deliver mediocrity. Azox Network does the opposite: we make specific promises and actually keep them. Fair gameplay. Real security. Genuine accessibility. A server run by someone who plays on it, not a faceless corporation farming engagement metrics.

You want a Minecraft SMP where your time matters, your builds are safe, and the playing field is level? You've found it.
