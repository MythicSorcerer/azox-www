# Season 3 - Change 1
A brand new sidebar has been added that tracks kills. I'm almost certain some greedy people will repeatedly kill the same people and spawn trap people for easier kills. Because of that I am making spawn trapping (defined as killing a person as soon as they respawn more than once) a bannable offense. 

On Febuary First, I will award the person with the most *legitimate* kills a maxed out netherite sword with **SHARPNESS X** (for those doubters out there that's the diffrence between 11 damage and 14.5 damage before armor, crit, effects or a 3.5 increase, whereas strength 2 gives +6 damage, guys it looks cool but its not that insanely op)
